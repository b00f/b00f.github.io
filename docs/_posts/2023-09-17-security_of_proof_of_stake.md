A blockchain is defined as a chain of blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions.
Based on this definition, an attacker, or a group of attackers, could select any block as a base point and
attempt to create an alternate fork.

In this article, we'll explore these potential malicious behaviors.

## Long Range attack

In a Long-Range attack, attackers choose a block from the past and try to create an alternate chain starting from that block.
The main goal is to rewrite the blockchain's history
By doing so, they can add or remove transactions they desire.
Because the attack begins from an earlier point in the blockchain, it is termed a "Long-Range" attack.

But how likely is this attack in different blockchains?
And what is the solution?

### Proof-of-Work

In the case of Bitcoin, since the hashing power has constantly increased over time,
rewriting past blocks requires a huge amount of energy.
It is almost impossible for attackers to rewrite the last 6 blocks.

Indeed, Satoshi Nakamoto [showed](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) that with a **probability less than 0.1%**,
an attacker with 10% of the mining power can rewrite the last 5 blocks (less than one hour),
while an attacker with 45% of the mining power can rewrite the last 340 blocks (about 56 hours, or 2.5 days).

The chart below shows the probability of rewriting blocks by an attacker with 10% of the mining power.

Unfortunately, many proof-of-work blockchains don't have a hash rate growth like Bitcoin's. In some blockchains, like [Bitcoin SV](https://www.bitcoinsv.com/), the hashing power even dropped over time.

### Proof-of-Stake

This attack in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains appears more [serious](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1382241.0).
In these blockchains, attackers can obtain (or even purchase) the private keys from early validators.
If you possess enough keys, you can reorganize a new fork from early blocks (even from the genesis block!) and attack the blockchain.
Considering there is no actual work involved, just staking, reorganizing the blockchain becomes very easy.

### Solution

So, as you can see, most blockchains appear vulnerable to long-range attacks. However, this attack is not serious and can even be ignored.
**Simply because any chain that looks new can be ignored,** and miners or validators can always add blocks to the chain they know.

Satoshi Nakamoto also [mentioned](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) this in the Bitcoin whitepaper:

> Even if this is accomplished... nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes
> will never accept a block containing them.

## 51% and Nothing-at-stake attacks

Attackers may choose to create a fork at the tip of the blockchain.
By doing so, they can execute a double-spending transaction.
For example, in one fork, Eve sends coins to Alice, and in another fork, she sends the same coins to Bob.
This attack is known as the "51% attack" in proof-of-work blockchains and "Nothing at stake" in proof-of-stake blockchains.

### Proof-of-Work

The consensus mechanism in Proof-of-Work blockchains prioritizes liveness over safety.
This means the blockchain doesn't necessarily provide safety, and there might be more than one valid block at each height.

In the case of Bitcoin, forks can happen but very rarely.
And since the hashing power is high, the chance of an attacker creating a fork longer than two blocks is really low.
This is why in many exchanges, you have to wait for at least 2 block confirmations before withdrawing or depositing your Bitcoins.

Most people think that proof-of-work blockchains are more secure than other consensus types,
but in the real world, Proof-of-Work blockchains are more vulnerable to this attack.
For example, in Ethereum Classic, we have a history of a 51% attack by
[injecting](https://hackmd.io/@cUBb4hAvQciAEPoU2yfrzQ/Skd4X6MZw) more than 3000 blocks by only one miner.

### Proof-of-Stake

The consensus mechanism in proof-of-stake blockchains can prioritize liveness over safety[^1].
Blockchains like Ethereum prioritize liveness, and therefore, attackers with enough stake can create a valid fork.

![Liveness over safety](../../../assets/images/liveness_over_safety.png)

To overcome these scenarios, there is a mechanism in Ethereum to
[punish](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/)
the validators that double-vote in different forks.

On the other hand, some blockchains prioritize safety over liveness.
In these cases, there's no way to have a fork at the tip of the blockchain.

![Safety over liveness](../../../assets/images/safety_over_liveness.png)

If a fork happens, it is the result of a bad implementation or, even worse, the majority of the nodes
(with more than â…” of the total stake) are not loyal and honest.
So, the Nothing-at-stake attack in these blockchains are not possible.
Blockchains like Algorand and Pactus are not vulnerable to the Nothing-at-Stake attack,
and therefore there is no need for a slashing mechanism there.
