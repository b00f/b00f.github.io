I am really obsessed with the Gnome desktop, and I don't want anything on my desktop, even the Trash bin.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good and simple extension for managing the Trash bin.
so I wrote the [Gnome Trash](https://github.com/b00f/gnome-trash) extension to manage the trash items.

With the help of the Gnome Trash extension, you can manage your trash items and open or empty your trash folder.
You can also easily search for items inside the trash.

## Additional Features

- It's powered by TypeScript.
- You can sort trash items by "Deleted time" or "file name."
- Activation behavior options: Open, Restore, or permanently delete the file.
- The button is hidden when the trash is empty.

## Installation

To install the latest release, visit Gnome Trash on the
[Official GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4410/gnome-trash/) page.
