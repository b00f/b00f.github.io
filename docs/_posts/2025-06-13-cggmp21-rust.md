In one of my previous roles, I was part of a cryptography team responsible for implementing threshold signatures for ECDSA.
This work is particularly important for many blockchains—like Bitcoin and Ethereum—that use ECDSA,
which unfortunately doesn’t natively support multi-signature or threshold signature schemes.

While Bitcoin has recently adopted [Schnorr signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature) (which do support native multisignatures and it is very simple which I like it),
ECDSA remains dominant in the ecosystem. For threshold ECDSA, one of the most efficient and well-designed protocols to date is CGGMP21.

The protocol is detailed in the paper “UC Non-Interactive, Proactive, Threshold ECDSA with Identifiable Aborts.”
The acronym CGGMP comes from the initials of the authors’ last names.

What sets CGGMP21 apart is its non-interactive design: parties can perform most of the computation ahead of time (in a pre-signing phase), and the actual signing process can be completed efficiently without repeated rounds of interaction. It also features proactive security and identifiable aborts, making it resilient and robust for real-world use.

We had successfully implemented CGGMP21 internally, but unfortunately, the project remained closed-source and was never published—which is a shame, considering how valuable it could be to the wider ecosystem.

Recently, I came across a new Rust implementation of CGGMP21 that is open-source. It's exciting to see the community making this cutting-edge cryptography more accessible, and I highly recommend checking it out if you're working on threshold signing for ECDSA.
