In one of my previous roles, I was part of a cryptography team responsible for implementing threshold signatures for ECDSA.
This work is particularly important for many blockchains—like Bitcoin and Ethereum—that use ECDSA,
which unfortunately doesn’t natively support multi-signature or threshold signature schemes.

While Bitcoin has recently adopted [Schnorr signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature)
(which do support native multisignatures and it is very simple which I like it),
ECDSA remains dominant in the ecosystem. For threshold ECDSA,
one of the most efficient and well-designed protocols to date is [CGGMP21](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060.pdf).

The protocol is detailed in the paper “UC Non-Interactive, Proactive, Threshold ECDSA with Identifiable Aborts.”
The acronym CGGMP comes from the initials of the authors’ last names.

What sets CGGMP21 apart is its non-interactive design.
The actual signing process can be completed efficiently without repeated rounds of interaction (in a pre-signing phase).
It also features proactive security and identifiable aborts, making it resilient and robust for real-world use.

We had successfully implemented CGGMP21 internally, but unfortunately, the project remained closed-source and
was never published. Considering how valuable it could be to the wider ecosystem.

Recently, I came across a new Rust implementation of CGGMP21 that is [open-source](https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21).
It's exciting to see the community making this cutting-edge cryptography more accessible,
and I highly recommend checking it out if you're working on threshold signing for ECDSA.
