One of the best passages in literature is “[The Grand Inquisitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor)”
story in Fyodor Dostoevsky of The Brothers Karamazov novel.

I like the part that the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus:

“We are not with you, but with him (Satan), and that is our secret!
We corrected your great work.
Our kingdom built on your name.
Why have you come back now to trouble us? Go, don’t come to us anymore”
