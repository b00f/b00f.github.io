One of the most profound and fascinating pieces of literature is the story of “[The Grand Inquisitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor).”

"The Grand Inquisitor" is actually a short story within the main story of "The Brothers Karamazov,"
a novel by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky).
The story is set in Spain during the Spanish Inquisition, a time when the Catholic Church was the main power in Europe.
This passage, which is almost independent of the rest of the book, narrates the return of Jesus, performing miracles in Spain.
The Church discovers Him and orders His capture.
Later, Jesus is arrested by the Inquisition.

A dialogue happens between Jesus and the Grand Inquisitor. The talk is intense, profound, and philosophical.
The Grand Inquisitor threatens to burn Jesus and says to Him:

“We are not with you, but with him (Satan), and that is our secret! We corrected your great work.
Our kingdom is built on your name. Why have you come back now to trouble us? Go, don’t come to us anymore.”

## Security or Freedom

In my point of view, the story is philosophical battle between the freedom and security.
The Grand Inquisitor argues that humanity cannot handle the burden of true freedom, as granted by Jesus,
and that people would rather have security and happiness, even if it means sacrificing that freedom.

If you haven't read the book, you can watch this short video. Anytime I watch this video, I learn something new.
