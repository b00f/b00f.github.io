A Sybil attack occurs when an attacker or a group of attackers creates multiple fake identities to
gain control or influence over a network.

It seems that the best solution to prevent Sybil attacks is to **weight the votes** within the network that
cannot be tampered or modified easily.
However, the question remains: how can this be done?

Bitcoin addresses this issue by weighting nodes based on the work they contribute to the consensus protocol,
instead of relying solely on identity, such as IP addresses:
"If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote,
it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.
Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote."[^1]

Proof-of-Stake blockchains, weigh users based on the money in their account.[^2]
This money is usually locked and cannot be transferred.

An alternative approach is to weight nodes based on their reputations.
[EigenTrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EigenTrust) prevents Sybil attacks by
using a reputation management algorithm in peer-to-peer networks.

Sybil attacks are challenging to address, and a combination of various methods
may be required to mitigate the risks associated with such attacks.
