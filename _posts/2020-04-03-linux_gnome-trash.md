If you are obsessed with Gnome desktop, as I am, and you want a clean desktop with no icon
you can use Gnome Trash extension for managing the trash items.

With [this extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4410/gnome-trash/)
you can manage your trash items and open or empty your trash folder.
Also you can easily search items inside trash.

### Features

- It's powered by Typescript
- Sorting trash items by deleted time or file name
- Activation behavior: Open, Restore or permanently delete the file
- Hiding the button when trash is empty


Have fun with your trash!
