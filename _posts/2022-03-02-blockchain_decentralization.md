A blockchain as can't be fully decentralized, either its Proof of Word or Proof os Stake blockchain.
The reason is the incentivize mechanism: "This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network[...].
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest."[^1]

Without incentive no one will participate in the blockchain and as mater of fact it won't be decentralized.
Incentives has a side affect, people who joined the network earlier, take this advantages and collect more coins.
For example, most os us was not aware of Bitcoin at first four years, however %50 of the coins is distributed that time.

In Proof of Work blockchain people with more power can get more rewards, and they can increase their power faster than others.
In Proof of Stake this is even worse. since the voting power is the stake (or coin). So if you join earlier you have more coins and therefore more power.

But does it mean blockchain can't be decentralized.

## Two form of decentralizations

Decentralization has two categories:

- Network participants
- Asset holders

A successfully blockchain grows vertically and horizontally. It expands the application and also expands the normal user as asset holders.
Asset holders are another form of decentralization. If more people has more assets they can even have more influence on the network.
This is exactly what happened in SegWit upgrade and "user activated soft fork" or "UASF"[^2].
