Consider a blockchain project with thousands of codes as a black box. There may be some critical bugs or issues hidden there. Each of them can act as a potential bomb and if someone find and trig them, they can cause serious damage. But how does a blockchain get secured against these potential bombs?

The answer is "Decentralization". Decentralization makes a blockchain secure even if it has potential bugs or issues.

If a blockchain is not decentralized, it doesn’t have value and therefore no one will care about it. Even a hacker does bother himself and find the bomb, it doesn’t matter. No one gets hurt by exploding a bomb inside a desert.

But how about a decentralized blockchain? What happens if someone finds one of the bombs inside the blockchain? There is two real-world scenario that can happen here:

1- A [white hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) hacker finds the issue first and reports it to the community and tries to fix it. Like disposing the bomb before exploding. The [Bitcoin Transaction Malleability](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/12/what-the-bitcoin-bug-means-a-guide-to-transaction-malleability/) is a good example of how the community can find, report and fix a potential issue before it causes any serious damage.

2- A [black hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)) hacker finds the issue first and uses it for personal interest. This damage is destructive. But even in this case -if a blockchain is truly decentralized- the community can recover the blockchain from the damage. I can't imagine a scenario worse than [DAO attack](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/20/did-ethereum-learn-anything-from-the-55m-dao-attack/) in Ethereum. In the DAO attack more than 3.64 million or about 5% of the total supply got hacked (today the price is more than 10 billion USD!). But the community decided to undo this attack by forking the blockchain. It was [funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O5fdMFKEC0) but it worked!

As a conclusion, __decentralization makes a blockchain secure, not the algorithm__, but the algorithm is important to make a blockchain decentralized. A badly implemented or sophisticated blockchain can’t be decentralized. It is the chicken and egg story.
